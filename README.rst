My custom OpenWrt build and packages repo for TP-Link TL-WR842ND. I created it for personal use and so documentation is quite weak, but
I'll be happy if you'll use something from here.

Summary
=======

Minimalistic OpenWrt without girl's stuff like UCI firewall, web interface, uhttpd, but mc with subshell, UTF-8 support, bash, openvpn, su, tcpdump are available
out the box. Package repository is small too and includes monit, python, `my own feed <https://github.com/DmitryFillo/openwrt-feed>`_, etc.

This is very basic feautre overview, so some interesting stuff is not described. You can check build config for more information.

Versions
========

* 15.05
